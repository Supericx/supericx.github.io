Overvalue ones’ self can bring him self-destruction easily, I told myself lately. Things almost never went south when people are paying attention. So it is easier to recovery from dust than rise up from glory. 

I was looking for a purpose to live, and of course I knew the answer is not necessarily rational or even real. Along the path, I might get the false impression of finally getting one but it turns out to be wrong after time. I have over ninety percent confidence that I have found it this time: Space. 

Fully automatous system is very important. By automatous system, I am not only referring to robots. It could be a business automatous system where you input resources and time and output more resources for future input. Of course I am also referring to robots. Robots are replacement for human labor, and it will free human mind and improve us as a species in the future. The timing is important because there is no way to avoid some level of downturn for financial and belief system once the labor is replacing by machine, just like old times. But we must believe that once the fundamental changes are done, everyone will be better off. Just like old times. To minimize the unnecessary uncomfortableness of the changes, timing is essential. 

Spaces comes next. If I tell you that there is a bunch of aliens on another planet, and they never set a foot out of their planet no matter how advanced their technology has developed. What do you think? I think there is something wrong with them. And we, as human, has never left ours. This is the furthest rationalization that I can make for my answer, and I don’t think it is necessary to talk about this subject more. 

"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship, Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
