"When i was younger, so much younger than today. I never needed anybody's help in any way. 

But now these days are gone, im not so self assured.

...

and now my life have changed in so many ways,

my independence seems to vanish in the haze."

The weather has been good. Warm but not too hot, with bit of wind here and there, it was just a mediocore normal fine-weathered day. 

A mediocore normal fine-mooded young man walking along his mediocore normal fine-flavored life.

counting the seconds passing by,

cause things do not seem so right

things he sees are different from other eyes

he was wrong and they were right

outdated theory and outdated mind

that is all he will have

that was not me. me have the updated theory and an outstanding mind. me beat the time and me see things right. me sleeps along the stars and me often shine. me came, me saw, and me get out of it.

"Ive lived a life thats full, ive travelled each and every highway, and more much more than this, I did it my way"

"Regrets, ive had a few
but then again too few to mention.
i did waht i had to do and saw it through without exemption"

writing without logic is fun but reading it is hard. so the logic here is that shit happens and it happens to everyone. people just try to lie to themselves that shit did not happen and it is a bad way to compensate sadness. it is a bad way to fail life. 

A good way to fail life is to do it for something biger than life, 

and that thing that is biger than life is glorious

it is something that is special

it is beautiful

it is literally a basket of chicken tendies.

well, second thought, nuggets are just as good.

now i just wasted your time and dont fucking blame that on me.
