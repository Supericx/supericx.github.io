title: New Year Resolution 2
---

New Year Resolution 1 failed. Nineteen days into 2018, and here comes the resolution.

2017 was okay. Sleeps were better. Portfolio is doing well with .37 gain. Bikes remained untouched most of the time. I gamed a lot, and they are fascinating. Also, ive done some 

Maybe I should talk more about games. Games has exists for quite awhile (you google it). Games might change a lot in near future, but that is not the point i am trying to make. The point I am trying to make is, game has the potential of helping one achieve his or her purpose as human, creation, and I respect this form of art for this. 

Things are changing, like they always have been. Abstraction simplifies the complex relationships between fundamentals, makes them look perfect. This way of thinking makes the evaluation of changes and predicting the changes easier. I heavily rely on this way of thinking, but today i come to question it. Things work out in digital does not mean they will do the same in analog. Details get lost here and there when those abstractions were made. So maybe messes are good, and down to the earth is crucial.
