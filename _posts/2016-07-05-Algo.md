So after playing with IB's API a little bit, I think it is time to really look into its API and maybe build a legit structure for algo trading. Before getting into the details, maybe it is better to do a little bit thinking first.

The goal is never beating the market. I think it is very important to understand the market before getting inside of it. Like natural science, some very simple, basic rules control the changing world. However, a new thinking will be needed for predicting the weather because the goal is not to get absolutely right but to get the most accurate as we can get. It is about timing. I believe predicting the stock market is just like trying to predict the weather or the earthquake, but harder. So the idea here is the goal is to get a structure that is flexable enough to include more indicators in the future. Maybe indicators arent the right way. Who knows. The important thing is to get started ASAP.
