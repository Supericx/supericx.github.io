Bob Dylan is DAT BEST!

"May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift, may you have a strong foundation, when the winds of changes shift."
This is my 20th year in this world and yet I haven't found my path. There was ups and downs like a candle graph of lending club. There was days I won't forget and days I can't. There was people come and go, and some still sticking around. I am grateful for what I have now and always will keep my hands busy. 

"May you stay forever young."
Future requires caring, planning, and acting. I have some days when I always care, some other I planed too much, and some I only do. When I was only caring, I was depressed. The emotion, information overflow me, and I was broke. When I plan, I was lost. When I only do, I failed.

"May you always do for others, and let others do for you"

"May you build a ladder to the stars, and climb on every rung,"

"May you always be courageous, Stand upright and be strong,"

In the foreseeable future, automated stock trading and "THATVIDEOPROJECT" is going to be my focus. I allow around 5 years to achieve something in these two areas.
