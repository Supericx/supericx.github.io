"but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning 'round.'"

"Some days i sit, staring out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothing to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think im crazy
im crazy oh so crazy
why am i here, am i just wasting my time
...
but sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leaning on me"

"Imagination is silly
you go around willy nilly
for example i go around wanting you
and yet i cant imagine that you want me too"

one band and two artist define a large portion of me. I used to think music as snacks, something i turn to when life bores me. It literally is a kind of entertainment, so it should not be anything serious. Then today it hit that i did not turn to music when life bores me. I turn to music when life goes by, or should i say that music levitates me from life when necessary. 

I dont have a beautiful voice. Lately i just proved that i dont have musical talent, maybe, but it still gets me really hard every time i listen.

"Oh yeah, all right, are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?
love you, love you, love you, love you.....
...
and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make."

Beatles. A band that i hated for years. A band that stood by me when the night had come and the land was dark. I was afraid. A band that stood by me when the sky trumbled and fell. At first it was just Lennon's songs. they are so loving and cynical at the same time, but then other beatles songs started to make sense to me, especially paul and lennon's. 

"your day breaks
your mind aches
you find that all her words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
...
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years"

Bob dylan. who taught me how to be a loser. who taught me how to attach to nothing while being open-minded. Since he likes frank sinatra so much lately, ive been listening to a lot of frank sinatra's songs. I have to say that he has really good taste when it comes to music. being real,  being true, being humble, and being curious is what he told me through his songs.

"people tell me its a sin
to know and feel too much within
i still believe she was my twin
but i lost the ring
she was born in spring
but i was born too late
blame it on a simple twist of fate."

Eminem. Nothing much to say about this one, a quote from his newly release ablum song will suffice.

"but sometimes i overdo it
but i just get so into it
i was there consolin' you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door, you walked over to it
im the lightat the end of the tunnel
so people are always looking to me as theyre going through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since cleanin' out my closet when i was having trouble with the snare
im that unrealistic prayer
and ima get you jacked up
like youre tryna fix a flat
when you struggle with despair
that double fisted bare knuckles coupled with this pair of nuts im cupping"

I dont know what rock is anymore. Sometimes its hip-hop, and sometimes its jazz. I can hear it in electronic even. I guess if youre being technical, you can say that rock can be classified by its chords or the musical instrument that it uses. despite this, the point im trying to make is that the spirit carries onto other genres and it never dies. It helps me get detached from reality and see from a different angle every now and then. It helps me keep losing without falling. A perfectional loser. i dont know about you but at least in rock i trust.
