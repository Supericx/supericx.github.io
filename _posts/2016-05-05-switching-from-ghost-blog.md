#What happen to Ghost Blog

I have always been a loyal customers to Ghost. When they first public the open source project, I was the one configuring Amazon aws to get it working. Then, they published the Ghost(pro) program which charged about $5 back then. Years over years, now it's 29 per month and it is going crazy. The glory "open source" now become this "gold machine". So I abandoned it.

#New things in here

So I chose hosting my blog using github page in a way of saying I will start to program more now. I really like the theme(thanks to the author: Micah Cowell). Very clean, beautiful work.

Also, I am starting on this video project which is still trying to fiugre out the direction.

I guess this is all.
