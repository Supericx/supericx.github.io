Title: New Year Resolution
---

Based on the date of this resolution, i guess the first on the list should be eliminating procrastination. 

2016 was not the easiest year for me. 2016 was a year that has 365 days and each day has 24 hours. Every moments, something was happening somewhere, i guess.

Of course, I’ve changed some, as always. I didn’t ride as much bikes as before. That gives me something to work on. I got some cash out of the stock, luckily. The things that worries me the most is I am loosing that grasp of faith in our race.

Look at what we’ve done, as human. We eat, sleep, breath and feel. That’s about it. We do things to each other. We have great man who accomplish amazing things and benefits millions and we have people that are unkind. While there are so many flaws, fundamental flaws laying in our blood, there are also surprises in life that gives it meaning. 

What can I say?

There isn’t really much that can logically ease my mind.  But at the end of the night, it’s that little faith I still hold on to get me through the night.

resolution:
bikes
sleeps
and it’s time to begin
